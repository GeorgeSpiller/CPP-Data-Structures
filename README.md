# Info
This repo contains some examples of common data structures. See bellow for info on the data structures curently implemented.  
The base class `gsds_data_structure` is inherited by all data structures.  
The class `gsds_data_linear` is inherited by all linear data structures (stack, queue) and handels the memory allocation.  

# Currently implemented data structures:
- LIFO Stack
- FIFO Queue  

# Compile command using GCC:
To Compile:
`gcc -o main gsds_main.cpp -lstdc++`  
>`gcc`         : The compiler executable  
>`-o main`     : set the output name of the compiled exe  
>`-lstdc++`    : arg includes std lib  

To run:
    `.\main.exe`
